# SwaveBot_ Commands
### Queue User Commands:
###### !join : Join the current queue if it is enabled
###### !leave : Leave the current queue
###### !size : Returns the number of people in the current queue
###### !position : Returns what position you are in the queue
###### (note: viewer tournaments randomize the queue so position doesn't matter)
## Queue Mod Commands:
###### (Note: all these mod commands require !q before them. Ex: !q open)
##### open/start/begin : starts queue
##### stop/end/close = closes queue (still allows most commands except users joining the queue. So you can still get the next person in queue or make teams or whatever. And people can still leave the queue)
##### enable/on = turns queue on
