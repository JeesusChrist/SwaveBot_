## Queue Mod Commands:
###### (Note: all these mod commands require !q before them. Ex: !q open)

##### clear/reset = empties queue 
##### add/adduser/addviewer = manually adds a person to the queue, can @ them or just type it out(example: “!q add jeesuschristt” or “!q add @jeesuschristt” do the same thing)

##### next = gets the next user in queue, can also print multiple users(example: “!q next 4” gets the next 4 users, “!q next” gets a single user)
